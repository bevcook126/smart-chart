<div align = center><h2>Description :pencil:</h2></div>
As a former teacher, I've changed up my seating chart in the following ways:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>running around my classroom with sticky notes on the desks</li>
    <li>drawing a map of the room only to write names, erase, and rewrite them until they are no longer legible</li>
    <li>using blocks and dolls on the floor as a model to rearrange seats</li>
</ul>
These methods worked fine, but when my students would come in and sit at their new spots, I would immediately see something I missed. I would either sit two students next to each other that were more successful separated or fill an entire table with students who don't get along.

<br/><br/>
SmartChart allows teachers to visualize their classroom and see their students' faces in potential seats before the bell rings. Teachers can add students to the app with a name and an image, then assign these students to a grid layout. Upon seeing the potential seating arrangement, teachers can visualize and catch any less-than-ideal pairings, and separate Jerry Seinfeld and Newman before rolling out the new seating chart.<br/>
